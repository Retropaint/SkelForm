# Skeller_wgpu

Skeller was originally made in Miniquad, but with some convincing from the Rust gamedev Discord, it has been migrated to WGPU for better long-term support (if it will survive to need it).

## Acknowledgements

This project uses the matthewjberger/wgpu-example repo as the starting template for EGUI integration. Much of it's structure is still intact, as of writing this README.
