# Release

This folder contains all* assets and scripts for release distributions.

\*Web builds are done with `web_build.py`, which is in root.

## Building

Run `release.py`.

This will create a release distribution with your OS as the target.

### Mac

By default, the mac release only builds `SkelForm.app`.

The release script provides a `-dmg` flag to attempt to build a DMG instead (requires [create-dmg](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg))

### Windows

To be documented.

### Linux
